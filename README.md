This repository houses a C++ project tailored for managing and analyzing pupil weight records. The project encompasses three key objectives:

Task 1: Input and validate the weights and names of 30 pupils on the first day of term, ensuring data accuracy.
Task 2: Record the weights of the same pupils on the last day of term, calculate the weight differences, and store the results for analysis.
Task 3: Identify pupils with significant weight changes (>2.5 kg) and report their details.

While the current implementation focuses on fundamental data processing and analysis, the modular structure of the code allows for future enhancements and extensions. Potential areas for expansion include incorporating advanced algorithms for predictive modeling based on historical weight data or implementing text analysis techniques for more in-depth examination of pupil records.This project serves as a versatile toolkit for efficiently managing and examining pupil weight data, with opportunities for continual improvement and customization. Contributions and feedback from the community are warmly welcomed as we strive for excellence in data management."
